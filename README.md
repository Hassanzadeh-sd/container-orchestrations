## Why we need Container Orchestration

- We don't like pets in server farms :)
- We want zero downtime
- We want auto-scaling
- We want to go across different cloud providers

# Container Orchestration Options

- [Docker Swarm](swarm/README.md)
- [Kubernetes](kubernetes/README.md)
- [Mesos Marathon](mesos/README.md)
- Cloud Foundry Diego
- Apache Aurora
- Amazon ECS
- Azure container Service

As you could guess, it becomes difficult to choose one. So we thought of taking one Real World App and deploy it in different orchestration engines. For now we would look into Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Mesos marathon.

## What is needed to do the Container Orchestration

### Multiple Nodes to be part of a cluster

### Unique ID/Token to bind all the nodes in a unique cluster

### Container Engines
- Docker 
- Rkt

### Single source of truth about configuration for nodes
- Key-Value Store like etcd, consul

### Network for containers of different nodes to talk to each other
- Some form of Overlay network like VxLAN. 
- With possibility to plug different neworking solution like Calico. 

### One or more cluster master to manage the cluster and schedule the jobs/tasks  

### Scheduler to schedule the containers on nodes based on
- Constraints, like run the container where SSD storage is available
- Affinity

### Service discovery within the cluster
- Internal DNS server
- Through environment variables 
- Load balancer, HA proxy

### Access to external shared storage
- Volume plugins

## Examples 

We are going to look at two examples :-

### [dockchat](https://github.com/nicolaka/dockchat.git)

This is a simple example, which I borrowed from from [DockerCon EU tutorial](https://github.com/docker/dceu_tutorials/blob/master/02-orchestration.md). In that tutorial, the steps are given to orchestrate the simple chat application using Docker Swarm. Here would take that same app and deploy it using Kubernetes and Mesos.

- Swarm 
  * [Docker Compose - Single system](simple_dockchat/swarm/compose)
  * [Docker Compose - Swarm Cluster](simple_dockchat/swarm/1_master_2_nodes)
  * [Swarm cluster with Interlock](simple_dockchat/swarm/1_master_2_nodes_interlock)
  * [Swarm cluster with Overlay network](simple_dockchat/swarm/1_master_2_nodes_overlay)
  
- [Kubernetes](simple_dockchat/kubernetes/)

- [Mesos](simple_dockchat/mesos/)


### Magento

We thought a real world e-commerce platform would be a nice and came
across [Magento](https://magento.com/). While doing some browsing we 
came across [this blog post](http://mageinferno.com/blog/deploy-magento-2-digital-ocean-tutum)
to deploy Magento2 on Tutum., which gave us good reference. 

So first we would deploy Magneto on differnet orhestration engines and
then experiment with features like replication, auto-scaling etc.
